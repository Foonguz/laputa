Ferin: Hey Lye!
Lye: What?
Ferin: I have another joke!
Ferin: Look! I'm like a Hypocrita meres!
Lye: ...
Lye: From my map it looks like we're near
the place Laifioun told us about
it should be here underground 
Ferin: I wonder what we'll find down there
Lye: Whatever it is we'll probably not be alone
prepare for a fight
end
Lye: This seems to be it
Ferin: Looks rather, threatening
Lye: Whatever is hiding here we can handle it, now letâ€™s take this thing and leave 
Lye: Ferin? 
Lye: Ahhh! 
end
Lye: Ferin! Are you okay?
Ferin: I'm... Fine
but the object we came for isn't
Lye: Let's just get out of here
end
